            <p id="parapgrah1" class="text-container">I decided to work in the tech industry after a few years of soul-searching, looking for a line of work
            that would truly fit my skills and personality. I have always loved taking on challenges and working
            hard towards goals; for instance, in 2017 I qualified as an English teacher in the British school
            system, despite not being a native speaker. My lifelong passion for the English language and literature
            drew me to the education sector, and I thoroughly enjoyed being able to pass it on to teenagers.
            However, I slowly came to realise that I didn't love being in the classroom as much as I thought I
            would. I realised I craved more opportunities for reflective, analytical and theoretical work in my every day
            life, which was an aspect of academic research that I had relished and excelled at. </p>
            <p id="paragraph2" class="text-container">Those reservations led me to start thinking about other careers that I could find fulfilling, and
            software engineering appeared to be a field that would satisfy my desire for intellectually-challenging
            and meaningful work. I completed the Northcoders bootcamp course, and I found deep satisfaction and happiness as the weeks progressed and my skillset grew as I took on
            increasingly complex challenges. I am currently working in my first position as a Graduate Software Engineer at DAI (full stack), 
            learning to navigate complex software systems and integrating my work smoothly within existing code.
