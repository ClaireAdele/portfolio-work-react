Users can look for events based on their location or create a custom search, with the results displayed flexibly, on a map and in a list format. Then they can access further event information, including which other users looking for a buddy or attending. The in-built secure chat functionality allows users to message each other without having to share personal details with people they donâ€™t know well yet, keeping Gig Buddy users safe while they connect with new friends.",
